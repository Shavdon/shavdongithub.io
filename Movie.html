    <h1>Tulsa King</h1>
    <body>
        <p>After 25 years in prison, New York Mafia capo Dwight Manfredi has been released. 
            He is expecting a reward from his bosses for not rolling over on them but instead finds that time didn't stand still while he was inside.
             His boss and friend, the man who he can rely on to look after him, is now only nominally in power.
              His son makes all the decisions and doesn't view Dwight as favourably as his father.
              He sends Dwight to Tulsa, Oklahoma, as he views it as an untapped market.
             Dwight has nothing: he is going to have to build a crew and the Mafia's presence in Tulsa from the ground up.</p>
